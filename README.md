1.Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset. Provide visualizations and summary statistics of the variables. Pre process the data to apply the MLR.
2.Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).
3.Build a multiple linear regression model using the training dataset. Interpret the coefficients of the model. Build minimum of 3 different models.
4.Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate evaluation metrics on the testing dataset.
5.Apply Lasso and Ridge methods on the model.

Interview Questions:
1.What is Normalization & Standardization and how is it helpful?
2.What techniques can be used to address multicollinearity in multiple linear regression?
